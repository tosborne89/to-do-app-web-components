## How to run this project on your machine

Clone/download this repository into your htdocs/www folder. 

Because this project uses ES Module imports, you must use a web-server to load the page (eg: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```) and open the index.html. 

This was built using ES6, ES Modules and HTML Templates and done as a project to somewhat learn vanilla JS custom web components.
